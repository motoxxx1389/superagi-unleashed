Let's start by creating the main classes and their methods as per the specification. We will be using Python for this task.

The main classes and their methods are:

1. `AgentInterface` Class: This class provides an interface for SuperAGI agents to interact with the toolkit.

2. `Project` Class: This class represents a project within the toolkit.

3. `Compiler` Class: This class is responsible for compiling projects into .exe files.

4. `InstallerPackager` Class: This class is responsible for packaging compiled .exe files with an installer.

Now, let's start creating the Python files for each of these classes.

1. agent_interface.py
