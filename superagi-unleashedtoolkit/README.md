Let's start by listing the main classes, functions, methods and their purposes:

Classes:
1. ApplicationBuilder: This class is responsible for creating the .exe application. It includes methods for setting up the application's properties and compiling it into an .exe file.
2. InstallerBuilder: This class is responsible for creating an installer for the .exe application. It includes methods for setting up the installer's properties and compiling it into an .exe file.

Functions:
1. compile_to_exe(input_files, output_file): This function takes the input files (source code, resources, etc.) and compiles them into a single .exe file. It uses the PyInstaller or cx_Freeze library for the compilation process.
2. create_installer(app_exe, installer_name): This function takes the .exe application file and creates an installer for it. It uses the Inno Setup or NSIS library for the creation process.

Methods:
1. ApplicationBuilder.set_properties(app_name, app_version, app_description): This method is used to set the properties of the application (name, version, description). These properties are embedded into the .exe file.
2. ApplicationBuilder.add_resources(resource_files): This method is used to add resource files (images, sounds, etc.) to the application. These resources are embedded into the .exe file.

Now, let's create the Python files for these classes, functions, and methods.

requirements.txt

(If superagi-unleashed doesnt install all the requirements then wait untill it is completely built and thn shut it back down with "Docker compose down" and then once it is shut all the way back down go to the terminal and enter "git clone https://github.com/idleberg/vscode-innosetup innosetup
" once complete then start the superagi program back up like normal "docker-compose up --build")

You may have to manually install pyinstaller, and if it errors from there, due to a path error, go to download it and copy the path it was downloaded into and add it into you environmental variables.
