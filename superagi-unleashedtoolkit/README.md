Based on the specification, we will have four main classes: CodeEditor, Compiler, Packager, and SuperAGIUnleashed. We will also need a requirements.txt file to list the dependencies.

Here is a brief overview of the classes and their methods:

1. **CodeEditor Class**: This class will have two methods, `input_code` and `upload_file`. The `input_code` method will allow users to directly input their code, while the `upload_file` method will allow users to upload a file containing their code.

2. **Compiler Class**: This class will have a `compile_code` method that will take the code from the CodeEditor class and compile it into a .exe application using PyInstaller.

3. **Packager Class**: This class will have a `package_exe` method that will take the .exe file from the Compiler class and package it into an installer using Inno Setup.

4. **SuperAGIUnleashed Class**: This class will instantiate the other three classes and use their methods to create the .exe application and its installer. It will provide a user-friendly interface guiding users through the process.

Now, let's write the code for each class and the requirements.txt file.
