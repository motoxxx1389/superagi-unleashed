Specification:

Program Name: SuperAGI Toolkit Repository

Program Description: The SuperAGI Toolkit Repository is a program designed to allow SuperAGI agents to create Windows .exe applications that can be installed upon opening them. The toolkit will provide a framework for the agents to build applications, compile them into .exe files and package them with an installer.

Core Classes/Functions/Methods:

1. `AgentInterface` Class: This class will provide the interface for SuperAGI agents to interact with the toolkit. It will contain methods for creating new projects, adding code files, compiling projects, and packaging them with an installer.

    - `create_project(name: str)`: Creates a new project with the given name.
    - `add_code_file(project_name: str, file_path: str)`: Adds a code file to the specified project.
    - `compile_project(project_name: str)`: Compiles the specified project into a .exe file.
    - `package_with_installer(project_name: str)`: Packages the compiled .exe file with an installer.

2. `Project` Class: This class will represent a project within the toolkit. It will contain properties for the project's name, code files, compiled .exe file, and installer.

    - `add_code_file(file_path: str)`: Adds a code file to the project.
    - `compile()`: Compiles the project into a .exe file.
    - `package_with_installer()`: Packages the compiled .exe file with an installer.

3. `Compiler` Class: This class will be responsible for compiling projects into .exe files.

    - `compile(project: Project)`: Compiles the specified project into a .exe file.

4. `InstallerPackager` Class: This class will be responsible for packaging compiled .exe files with an installer.

    - `package(project: Project)`: Packages the compiled .exe file of the specified project with an installer.

Non-Standard Dependencies:

1. `pyinstaller`: This library will be used to compile the projects into .exe files.
2. `nsis`: This tool will be used to create the installers for the .exe files. It is a professional open source system to create Windows installers.
3. `pywin32`: This library provides some useful methods for interacting with Windows.

In summary, the SuperAGI Toolkit Repository will provide a framework for SuperAGI agents to create, compile, and package Windows .exe applications. It will be built using Python and will utilize the pyinstaller, nsis, and pywin32 libraries.
